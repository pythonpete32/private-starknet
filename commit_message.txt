feat: implement account persistence system for Phase 3

- Create AccountStorage class with secure key generation using crypto.getRandomValues()
- Add AccountHelpers for account creation and commitment calculations
- Build AccountManager UI component with multi-account support
- Create SimpleWalletButton to replace complex WalletConnect component
- Fix syntax errors and import paths
- Add simple-test page for testing account persistence
- Update AppShell to remove sticky header behavior
- Fix ink-kit color violations (no more gray-100/200)

Current issue: Two separate wallet connection systems not synchronized
- SimpleWalletButton uses useWallet hook with WalletManager
- Old WalletConnect component uses starknetkit directly
- Need to unify wallet state management across the app
