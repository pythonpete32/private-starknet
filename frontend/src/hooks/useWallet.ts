// LEGACY FILE - REPLACED BY UNIFIED WALLET SYSTEM
// This useWallet hook is no longer used. All wallet functionality moved to:
// - providers.tsx (WalletProvider with React Context)
// - useWalletContext hook (replaces this hook)
//
// The new system provides:
// - Same interface: { isConnected, address, connect, disconnect }
// - Better performance (no custom state management)
// - Centralized configuration
// - Auto-reconnect built-in
//
// Can be deleted safely.
